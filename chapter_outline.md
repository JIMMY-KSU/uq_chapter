# Introduction

- what does PyMC do?
- why is MCMC related to UQ?

# Motivating UQ Example

- Gelman's radon environmental epidemiology study
- simple pooled model
- simplest hierarchical model as comparison

# PyMC Tutorial

## PyMC Objects

## The Basics of Theano

- tensors
- creating variables and functions
- important Theano functions

## Statistical Likelihoods

- creating custom stochastics

## Specifying a Model

- Model context manager
- generate estimates of simple problem using MAP

## Step Methods

- brief introduction to MCMC
- gradient-based methods

## Database Backends

## Running Models

## Summarizing Model Output

- plots and graphics

## Model Checking

- convergence diagnostics
- goodness of fit evaluation

## Debugging and Profiling PyMC
